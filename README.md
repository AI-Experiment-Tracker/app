# What is this
Something I find fascinatingly lacking in the tech space is the lack of adequate AI experiment tracking systems. So this is me trying to learn about making multi-repos and at the same time, seeing what I can learn about versioning different aspects of the AI/ML dev process.

Yet another collection of code I have no clue what it will become. But learning is always fun, so why not.

# Running Notes
- GitHub makes it impossible to do a collection of repos, so creating an "organization" is what I'm doing.
- Organizaing this code in the format of multi-repos so I can learn more about deploying lambdas.
  - Don't come for me that I'm doing it in separate repos. I'm just trying something.
